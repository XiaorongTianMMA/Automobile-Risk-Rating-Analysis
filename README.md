**Automobile Risk Rating Analysis**

**Introduction**

Welcome to my GitHub repository focused on predicting the automobile risk rating analysis. This project is an individual effort by Xiaorong Tian.

**Project Overview**

This project dives into the world of automobile risk rating. The aim is to understand the factors influencing the risk of automobiles, measured in terms of insurance risk rating. These insights are vital for stakeholders like producers, insurance providers, consumers, and regulators, all of whom seek to accurately predict risk of automobiles to increase profits and reduce potential losses.

**Objectives and Goals**

The primary objective of my project is to analyze how various factors - including producer, horsepower, fuel type, price, etc. - affect the risk rating of a vehicle. 

**Data and Methodology**

I utilize a comprehensive dataset containing 33 columns, offering detailed information about the performance and production data of the automobile. This dataset includes both numerical variables (like length, width, peak rpm, and price) and categorical variables (such as maker and body style). My findings highlight significant correlations between performance data and risk rating and also reveal a substantial relationship between price and risk among automobiles. I also discovered that an automobile's performance is highly dependent on its maker.
In this process, I conducted lots of feature engineering to fully utilize the data. For example, I use the length, width, and height to calculate their ratios, and it turns out these ratios are more representative than their components. The same pattern can be found in the power-to-weight ratio and engine efficiency I created from the original data.

**Applications and Benefits**

The solutions are designed to assist various stakeholders in the automobile industry. Producers can identify crucial factors for risk control to optimize production procedures. Insurance providers can focus on risk factors to figure out optimal pricing strategies for different automobiles. Consumers can gain deeper insights into different vehicles and make purchasing decisions based on various factors including risk and price.

I invite you to explore my repository and delve into the fascinating world of automobile risk rating with me.
